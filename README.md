## About The Project
The goal of the hackathon will be to create a Rest API system with NodeJS and MongoDB, test it with postman / insomnia, do unit tests and deploy it.

The API will be able to return the position of celestial bodies in the solar system on earth and calculate a person's life insurance against meteorites.
